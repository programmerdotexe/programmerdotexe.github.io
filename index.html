                        <p>I was born on May 17th, 2011. My Chinese zodiac sign is the rabbit. In the Chinese culture, the rabbit is known to be the luckiest out of all the twelve animals. It symbolizes mercy, elegance, and beauty. I am currently the shortest boy in my class, at 4' 2", which is around 2.664 adult giant pandas stacked on top of each other. Or, for all of you regular people, it is 1.27 meters. I have an older brother who is in 8th grade currently (That is, if it is February 2022).</p>

                        <p>Here are some facts: <br>•My favorite food is cheese. I like all kinds of cheese, as long the cheese is actual cheese. I don't like American cheese. <br>•My favorite animal is probably a Shiba Inu which is a type of dog that is very cute. Husky pups are also cute.<br>•My favorite dessert is ice cream.<br>•I am pretty good at public speaking around people who I am familiar with.</p>
